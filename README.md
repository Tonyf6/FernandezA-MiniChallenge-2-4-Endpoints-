Mini Challenge 2 - Endpoints (Adding,WakeUp,GreaterThanLessThan)
Starting a new mini challenge where we are revisiting C# to add 2 numbers using Endpoints, take inputs and display a sentence and finally being able to determine if two numbers are greater than, less than or equal to each other.
Person who Peer Reviewed me was Alejandro De La Cruz-Rubio
Peer Review Comment: End points work as they should. Code is clean and easy to follow. 10/10
